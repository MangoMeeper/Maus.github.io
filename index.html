		<h2>Hireling Morale</h2>
		<p>
			When a hireling or warband is placed in a <a>stressful situation</a>
, made to go without pay or food, or asked to
do something more <a>dangerous</a> than what they signed
on for, they must make a <a>WIL save</a> or <a>flee</a>. <br>

		<h2>Hireling Advancement</h2>
		<p>
			Hirelings and warbands can improve in the same way
that your player maus do. <br>
• Hirelings who receive a share of treasure gain 1 EXP
per pip they are given above their daily wage.<br>
• Warbands who receive share of treasure will gain 1 EXP
per 10 pips they are given above their weekly wage.<br>
Hirelings and warbands advance at the same rate as
player maus, so once they get 500 EXP, they advance to
Level 2.<br>
Not receiving a share of treasure may cause resentment

		<h2>Warbands</h2>
		<p>
			A maus is very small, and many beasts cannot be de-
feated working alone. When maus work together, they can
form a <a>warband</a>, and act on a <a>scale</a> capable of facing
other warbands or <a>large beasts</a>, like a cat or boar.

<h2>Forming A Warband</h2>
<p>A warband is formed by <a>20</a> or more <a>fighting maus</a>, plus
	one follower (luggage porter, cook, armourer) for every
	fighter. <br>
	Your maus can <a>form a warband</a> under their command.
	In a town or city, spend a week recruiting. Make a <a>WIL
		save</a> or <a>pay</a> 1000p.<br>
	Warbands start with:<br>
	<a>d6 hp, STR 10, DEX 10, WIL 10</a><br>
	<a>Damage: d6 clubs and axes</a><br>
	Warbands require 1000p a week for <a>upkeep</a> and wages.
	Failure to pay may result in mutiny.</p>

		<h2>Equipping</h2>
		<p>Equipment improves a warband’s abilities the same way

			price by 20.</p>

			Battles between warbands and warband-scale creatures
function the same as fights between small individuals.
Attacks deal damage to HP, then to STR. <br>
Attacks by a warband against a <a>non-warband scale</a>
creature are <a>enhanced</a>, any damage taken from
non-warband scale creatures is <a>ignored</a> unless it is
particularly destructive or large scale.
<h2>Casualties</h2>
<p>When a warband takes <a>critical damage</a>, they are <a>broken</a>
	and cannot act until <a>rallied</a>. At STR 0 the warband is
	<a>wiped out</a>. At <a>half STR</a>, the warband must make a <a>WIL

				you are given it, or you have taken
				it. In both cases, you may have to
				defend the property (especially if
				you stole it from someone who still
				wants it...) Either way, owning land
				allows you benefits in the town or
				area you own it.
				</p> 

				<p><a>Room and Board:</a> Instead of
					staying in an inn overnight, you
					can sleep in your own room for
					free! Each room you own can
					house one player/hireling.</p>

					<p><a>Storage:</a>Storing your items in the
						bank is the safest place to store
						them. There is no chance for
						stealing or damaging them. (The
						only time they are taken or
						inaccessible is when the town is
						taken over by Rats or another
						malicious species). You can also
						store your items in a room you
						own for free! Each room that you
						own can store six (6) slots. This is
						the same amount in your pack. The
						quality of your room will dictate
						what happens to your room after 3 days of
						time passes.</p>

						<p><a>Perks:</a>Owning a home comes with
							perks. You become a citizen of the
							town and may get invited to
							parties and gatherings.
							Additionally, you may have access
							to certain people that you
							otherwise wouldn't have, such as
							powerful noblemaus, knights, or
							tradesmaus. Creatures come to
							your home and may ask for help or
							might have jobs and quests for
							you. <br>
							Tunnels aren't affected by quality.
							For aesthetic purposes, they look
							like the average of the two rooms
							they connect.</p>

							<h2>Poor Room
								</h2>
								<p>Poor rooms are barely suitable to
									live in. They contain crude ground,
									walls, and ceilings that are
									typically untreated whatsoever. It
									is not a comfortable place and
									probably smells. These rooms have
									the simplest of furniture such as a
									stool, table, and rickety beds.
									If it were in a fallen log, this room
									would be soggy and have splinters.
									It wouldn't have uniform walls and
									it might have holes in it where
									small bugs get through. The door
									would be a leaf or a small tapestry.</p>

									<h2>Standard Room
										</h2> <p>Standard rooms are cozy,
											comfortable, and quaint. They are
											hewn, sculpted, or otherwise
											shaped with tools to some degree.
											They have mostly symmetrical
											walls and sometimes include a
											simple pattern, wallpaper, paint, or
											fabric. They feel familiar, homey,
											and usually include a smell that
											gets familiar and comforting over
											your time spent there. They
											include a variety of furniture including dressers, couches, end
											tables, food storage cabinets,
											artwork, coat racks, and other
											typical items found in a home.
											If it were in a fallen log, this room
											would be carved and have flat and
											dry floors, walls, and ceiling. There
											would be a nice trim carved into
											the walls with a couple small nails
											for hanging drawings and coats. It
											would smell pleasant and may
											include a simple rug. The door
											would be a series of boards held
											together by string, or a wooden
											round with a hinge. May have a
											window with blinds.</p>

											<p><a>											Standard Room Perks:
</a>
											If you own a home with at least 2
												rooms that are on average
												Standard quality, the following
												perks apply : <br>
												
												<ol>
													<li>You immediately gain one
														friend in town. Roll on the
														backgrounds and name
														table to find out who this
														friend is. This friend will
														give you details about the
														city, rumors they hear,
														and may even accompany
														you on some missions.</li>
													
													
													<li>You are invited to parties!
														Every once and a while,
														you'll get an invite to a
														party, wedding,
														celebration that includes
														food and some party
														favors like clothing, tools,
														weapons, or other items.</li>
													
													<li>People know you in town
														and you generally have a
														good reputation. When
														looking for hirelings, roll
														the die on the hireling
														chart twice and take the
														higher one.</li>
													<li>Neighbors will sometimes
														drop off food that they
														found or grew.</li></ul></p>

									
		<h2>Grand Room</h2>					<p>
										Grand rooms are exquisite and
										ornate. These rooms are built with
										precision and are sturdy. They
										often include beautiful rugs,
										artwork, and furniture and are
										simply pleasant to be in. Walls and
										furniture have intricate designs
										and everything is especially
										comfortable. The space smells
										fantastic and inhabitants feel a
										deep sense of security. They
										include special furniture like
										pianos, grand wardrobes,
										chandeliers, canopy bed frames, mirrors, and vanities.
										If it were in a fallen log, the wood
										inside would be stained and have a
										beautiful sheen. The ceilings and
										floors against the walls have
										intricately carved designs of
										animals, plants, or otherwise
										beautiful shapes. A grand rug
										covers the floor and detailed
										paintings hang on the walls. The
										room smells like incense and the
										finest of wood. The door would
										shut flush with the wall and be
										made of the same material. A
										brass knocker would be fixed to
										the front. Glass windows with
										curtains are next to the door.

									</p>
<p><a>Grand Room Perks:</a>
	If you own a home with at least 3
	rooms that are on average Grand
	quality, you gain the perks of the
	Standard rooms and the following
	perks apply.
	<ol><li>You have access to nobles
		and leaders of the town
		you reside in if you didn't

		<li>Shop keepers will give you

		<li>You are invited to the
			finest of parties and are
			often given jewelry,
			artwork, or special gifts as
			party favors.</li>
		<li>While taking a Long Rest in
			the home, treat it like a
			Full Rest.</li>
		<li>After sleeping in the grand
			room, you are well-rested
			and have advantage on the
			first roll that day.</li></ol>

		<h2>Saves</h2>
		<p>
			When you describe your maus doing something <a>risky</a>
where the outcome is <a>uncertain</a> and failure has <a>consequences</a>, the GM will ask you to make a save against
either STR, DEX or WIL. <br>
To make a save, roll a d20. If the result is <a>less than or
	equal</a> to the relevant attribute, your maus succeeds,
and suffers no consequences. If the result is over the
attribute, your maus fails, and suffers the consequenc-
es described by the GM. <br>
<a>• STR Saves:</a> avoid harm through physical power and
endurance <br>
<a>• DEX Saves: </a>avoid harm through quick reaction,
speed and agility<br>

			When a spell’s usage dots are filled, it is <a>depleted</a> and
cannot be cast. Each spell has a <a>recharge requirement</a>.
Fulfilling this requirement will coax the spirit back to the
spell and <a>clear all</a> of its usage dots.

<h2>Food</h2>
		<p>To keep your mouse well, you need
			to eat food. Eating food with every
			rest prevents you from having the
			hungry condition. Rations easily do
			the trick and can be foraged for on
			the path. Artisan food or especially
			exquisite food is better than mere
			rations and can give you benefits
			besides satiating your hunger.</p>

			<p><a>Meaty/Protein-rich foods:</a> After
				eating, the next STR save you roll
				has advantage.
				Examples include: Fried
				crickets, chicken eggs, fish
				eggs, fish, lizard steaks</p>

				<p><a>Sugary/fruity foods:</a> After eating,
					the next DEX save you roll has
					advantage.
					Examples include:
					strawberry shortcake,
					pumpkin pie, ice cream,
					mom's cupcake, raisin
					cookies</p> 

<p><a>Wholesome/vegetable-rich:</a> After
	eating, the next WIL save you roll
	has advantage.
	Examples include: kale
	soup, potato stew, fajitas,
	broccoli w/ cheese, spicy
	red pepper chips, alote,
	sautéed Brussel sprouts</p> 
<p><a>Chocolate:</a>  After eating, the next
